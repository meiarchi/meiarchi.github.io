title: 'Archaeological and Landscape Living Lab'
---

The theme of the summer school was to revive Abruzzo as a place. As an urban planning and landscape team, we designed the concept of an Archaeological and Landscape Living Lab. It was necessary through various activities throughout all seasons to attract tourists as well as residents who would return and live again in a place like this from agriculture.

Project was done with co-authors Adriana Menghi, Burak Aydin and Chiara Cossidente, under mentorship of prof. Massimo Angrilli and arch. Valentina Ciuffreda, summer school 2021.
