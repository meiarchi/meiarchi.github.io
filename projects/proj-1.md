title: 'Conceptual architectural competition_Modular Prefabricated House'
---
Organizer: Gradnja.rs · Year: 2025 · Type: Conceptual architectural competition

This regional competition invited architects to design a modular prefabricated house made up of three interconnected modules, each up to 50 m², with the goal of responding to the changing needs of a growing family. The brief emphasized adaptability, sustainability, and the creative use of prefabricated wooden, steel, or concrete systems. Entries were encouraged to reflect not only the physical context, but also the individuality of users and how their spatial needs might evolve

My design began with a question: How can a home grow with life — not just in size, but in character, intimacy, and experience?

The concept is based on a wooden structural system, using glulam beams and columns, designed to be modular, flexible, and buildable. The first 50 m² module includes all necessary functions for a couple, expanded vertically through a mezzanine level that creates spatial layering without increasing the footprint — offering both privacy and openness.

As the family grows, the house expands — not just horizontally, but vertically. One of the key ideas I explored was the possibility of removing and remounting the roof to add new layers over time. This required careful structural planning and logical sequencing of elements, while maintaining a clear visual identity and material honesty. The wooden roof frame remains visible, celebrating construction as architecture.

Each module was imagined not just as an addition, but as a new moment in life — a children's room, a workspace, a space for rest and reflection. The transitions between modules — both vertical and horizontal — were carefully planned to preserve light, views, and flexibility.

Throughout the process, I thought not only about how the house is built — but how it can be lived in, changed, and loved. I aimed to create a system that is grounded in tradition (drawing from Japanese and Scandinavian influences) yet made for real, modern families, with attention to buildability, proportion, construction details, and emotional quality.

This is not just a modular house — it is a living framework that can evolve with its inhabitants.
