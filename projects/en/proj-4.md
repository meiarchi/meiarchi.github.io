The work treats a selected area in Višnjička Banja in Belgrade, Serbia. The concept was based on a healthy city and sustainable architecture and living in modern dugouts with different private gardens. The  emphasis was on the contribution by little gardens that can produce food for house owners. 

The project was done under mentorship of prof. Zoran Đukanović in year 2017 winter semester.
