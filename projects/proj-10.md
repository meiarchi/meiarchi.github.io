In this role as an Junior Architect at Atelje AL, I was deeply involved in crafting small-scale urban designs, particularly for retail centers, private residences, and an upscale hotel. This encompassed the intricate task of designing both interior and exterior spaces, with a strong emphasis on luxury and aesthetics. My responsibilities extended to producing detailed design plans, developing captivating renders for both exterior and interior spaces, and contributing to the realization of high-end projects.

One notable achievement during my tenure at Atelje Al was my rapid acquisition of proficiency in Revit. Within just one month, I independently mastered this crucial architectural software, a feat that significantly bolstered my effectiveness in ongoing projects. This experience was transformative, enhancing my skill set and broadening my architectural perspective

I also did different design projects at my position in Berlin office Buro 213, but they are not displayed here.
