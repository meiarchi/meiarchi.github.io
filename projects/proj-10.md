I predominantly focused on interior design projects at my position at Urban pro in Belgrade Serbia. These projects catered to discerning clients with a strong penchant for luxury, necessitating a keen eye for detail and an innate sense of opulence and aesthetics.

In this capacity, I was responsible for crafting interior spaces that seamlessly blended sophistication with functionality. This encompassed the entire design process, from conceptualization to detailed planning and execution. My role involved developing comprehensive design plans, creating compelling renders for visualization, and overseeing the transformation of these concepts into real-world spaces.

I also did interior design at my position in Berlin office Buro 213, but they are not displayed here.
