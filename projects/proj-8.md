title: 'Vračar luxury housing'
---

The project was based in centre of Vračar in Belgrade, Serbia near temple st. Sava. The idea was to create luxury apartments as that area of Belgrade is characterized as a luxury location. The idea was to create special spaces on overhangs that extend like terraces from penthouses that have viewed on temple st. Sava or green areas near the building.  

The project was done under mentorship of prof. Shin Yokoo, prof. Vladimir Lojanica and Asst. Ksenija Pantović in year 2018 winter semester.
