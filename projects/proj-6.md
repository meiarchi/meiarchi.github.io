title: '”Kala” research center'
---

The work treats a selected area in Ada Safari in Belgrade, Serbia, but it can be implemented in other parts of the world. The idea was to create a research center that is suitable to be implemented in different locations and within it to investigate the biodiversity of that location. Modern steel construction was used for the project.

The project was done under mentorship of Asst. Dalia Dukanac in year 2016 winter semester.
