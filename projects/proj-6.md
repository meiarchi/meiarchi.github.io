title: 'Wooden Japanese pavilion'
---

Idea was to create a modern gallery with wooden construction. Through this project I wanted to explore traditional and modern Japanese constructions. Kengo Kuma’s modern Japanese roofs were my main research.

Project was done under mentorship of prof. Ljiljana Đukanović and asst. Dijana Savanović in year 2018 summer semester.
