Beyond architecture, I'm deeply drawn to photography, painting, and gaming â€“ all of which fuel my imaginative spirit. I thrive in collaborative environments, yet I'm equally adept at independent work. My experience spans working with international teams, bridging cultural differences effortlessly thanks to my fluency in different languages.</p>
